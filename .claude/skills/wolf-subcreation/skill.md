# Wolf's Subcreation Model

Source: Wolf, M.J.P. (2012). *Building Imaginary Worlds: The Theory and History of Subcreation*. Routledge.

Term "subcreation" borrowed from J.R.R. Tolkien — creating secondary worlds that achieve internal consistency and completeness.

## Core Concepts

### Transnarrative
Worlds that extend beyond any single story. The world exists as a container for multiple narratives.

**Implications:**
- World details can exist without being plot-relevant
- Background lore enriches foreground story
- Consistency matters even for unexplored areas

### Transmedial
Worlds that span multiple media platforms (books, films, games, etc.).

**Implications:**
- Each medium contributes unique elements
- Consistency across media is challenging but valuable
- Different media suit different aspects of world

### Transauthorial
Worlds developed by multiple creators over time.

**Implications:**
- Need for canonical authority/guidelines
- Risk of contradictions across creators
- Opportunity for emergent complexity

## Canonicity Circles

Wolf's model of world content authority:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│           APOCRYPHAL            │  Fan works, rejected ideas
│  ┌───────────────────────────┐  │
│  │       PERIPHERAL          │  │  Spin-offs, tie-ins
│  │  ┌─────────────────────┐  │  │
│  │  │       CORE          │  │  │  Primary texts, canon
│  │  │                     │  │  │
│  │  └─────────────────────┘  │  │
│  └───────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Core:** Primary texts, original creator's work, official canon
**Peripheral:** Licensed content, spin-offs, adaptations
**Apocryphal:** Fan works, rejected ideas, non-canonical explorations

## World Elements (Wolf's Categories)

### Maps and Geography
- Physical layout grounds the world
- Distances and travel times matter
- Unknown regions preserve mystery

### History and Timeline
- Events before the story begins
- Historical depth creates authenticity
- Avoid over-explanation (mystery is valuable)

### Cultures and Societies
- Distinct groups with internal logic
- Relationships between groups
- Cultural artifacts and practices

### Languages
- Naming conventions signal culture
- Language implies history
- Full conlangs optional but valuable

### Nature and Ecology
- Flora, fauna, climate
- Ecosystem logic
- Environmental constraints

### Infrastructure
- How society functions day-to-day
- Technology and its limits
- Economic and political systems

## Usage

When evaluating world depth:

1. **Check each category** — What exists? What's missing?
2. **Test canonicity** — What is core vs peripheral?
3. **Identify unexplored regions** — What mysteries remain?
4. **Assess coherence** — Do elements connect logically?

## Key Principle

> "The world can contain anything that can be experienced by characters within its fictional realm." — Wolf

But: coherence and internal logic make it believable.
