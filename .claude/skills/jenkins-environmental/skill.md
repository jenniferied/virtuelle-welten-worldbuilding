# Jenkins' Environmental Storytelling

Source: Jenkins, H. (2004). Game Design as Narrative Architecture. In *First Person: New Media as Story, Performance, and Game*. MIT Press.

Environmental storytelling uses space itself to convey narrative. Four types of narrative architecture:

## The Four Types

### 1. Evocative Spaces
**Definition:** Spaces that trigger pre-existing associations and memories.

**Mechanism:** Relies on audience's existing cultural knowledge.

**Design questions:**
- What real-world associations does this space evoke?
- What films, games, or stories has the audience seen before?
- How can we leverage nostalgia or cultural memory?

**Examples:**
- Gothic architecture → horror, mystery
- Neon-lit streets → cyberpunk, noir
- Soviet brutalism → cold war, authoritarianism

### 2. Enacted Stories
**Definition:** Spaces designed as staging grounds for player/character action.

**Mechanism:** Space enables and constrains behavior.

**Design questions:**
- What actions can characters take here?
- What is the space "for" (officially vs actually)?
- What paths exist for movement?
- What choke points, hiding spots, vantage points?

**Examples:**
- Arena → combat, performance
- Corridor → pursuit, linear progression
- Hub → choice, exploration, rest

### 3. Embedded Narratives
**Definition:** Stories told through environmental details and mise-en-scène.

**Mechanism:** Objects, arrangements, and clues reveal what happened.

**Design questions:**
- What happened here before the player arrived?
- What traces remain?
- What can be discovered by looking closely?
- What story do the objects tell?

**Examples:**
- Overturned furniture → struggle
- Faded photographs → lost family
- Graffiti → resistance, history
- Worn paths → frequent use

### 4. Emergent Narratives
**Definition:** Stories that arise from player interaction with systems.

**Mechanism:** Game systems create unpredictable narrative moments.

**Design questions:**
- What systems are present?
- How can player choices create stories?
- What emergent interactions are possible?
- How do NPCs remember player actions?

**Examples:**
- Reputation systems → consequences
- NPC schedules → witnessing events
- Resource scarcity → difficult choices

## Location Design Template

When designing a new location:

```markdown
## [Location Name]

### Evocative Layer
**Associations:** [What does this remind audience of?]
**Atmosphere:** [Mood, feeling]
**References:** [Films, games, real places]

### Enacted Layer
**Player Can:** [Possible actions]
**Player Cannot:** [Blocked actions]
**NPCs:** [Who uses this space, how]
**Paths:** [Entry/exit, secret routes]

### Embedded Layer
**Objects:** [What tells stories]
**History:** [What happened here]
**Details:** [Small things that reveal truth]

### Emergent Layer
**Systems:** [What game systems active here]
**Possibilities:** [What stories might emerge]

### Sensory Details
- **See:** [Visual]
- **Hear:** [Audio]
- **Smell:** [Olfactory]
- **Feel:** [Temperature, texture]
```

## Application to ПАНЕЛЬКИ

### Evocative
Soviet architecture, brutalist housing, trams, snow — triggers cold war, isolation, nostalgia

### Enacted
Courtyards for meeting, stairwells for hiding, trams for eavesdropping

### Embedded
Faded slogans, crossed-out names, patched pipes, children's drawings

### Emergent
Favor economy, surveillance, reputation among factions
