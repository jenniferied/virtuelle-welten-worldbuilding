# Zaidi's Seven Foundations

Source: Zaidi, L. (2019). Worldbuilding in Science Fiction, Foresight and Design. *Journal of Futures Studies*, 23(4), 15–26.

Worldbuilding is "the creation of imaginary worlds with coherent geographic, social, cultural, and other features." Use the Seven Foundations for systematic, first-principles world design.

## The Seven Foundations

### 1. Political
**Questions:** Who holds power? How is it maintained? What institutions exist? How is dissent handled?

**Analysis prompts:**
- Governance structures and hierarchies
- Laws and enforcement mechanisms
- Political factions and tensions
- Legitimacy of power (tradition, force, consent)

### 2. Economic
**Questions:** How are resources distributed? What is the currency/exchange? Who controls production?

**Analysis prompts:**
- Scarcity vs abundance
- Trade and markets (formal/informal)
- Class and wealth distribution
- Labor and production systems

### 3. Philosophical
**Questions:** What are the dominant belief systems? How do inhabitants understand existence?

**Analysis prompts:**
- Religion and spirituality
- Ethics and morality
- Concepts of meaning and purpose
- Taboos and sacred values

### 4. Environmental
**Questions:** What is the physical setting? How do inhabitants interact with environment?

**Analysis prompts:**
- Climate, geography, ecology
- Natural resources and constraints
- Human-environment relationships
- Environmental threats or changes

### 5. Scientific/Technological
**Questions:** What technology exists? What works, what's broken?

**Analysis prompts:**
- Technology level and distribution
- Scientific understanding
- Innovation and stagnation
- Technology's social impact

### 6. Artistic/Aesthetic
**Questions:** What is the visual language? What culture exists?

**Analysis prompts:**
- Art forms and expression
- Architecture and design
- Entertainment and media
- Cultural aesthetics

### 7. Social
**Questions:** How is society organized? What are the relationships between groups?

**Analysis prompts:**
- Family and kinship structures
- Social stratification
- Gender and identity
- Community and belonging

## Usage

When analyzing a world:

1. **Audit each foundation** — What is defined? What is missing?
2. **Check interconnections** — How do foundations influence each other?
3. **Identify gaps** — Which foundations are underdeveloped?
4. **Propose expansions** — What specific details would strengthen weak foundations?

## Key Concepts

### Coherence (Le Guin)
"The more realistic, exact, 'factual' detail in a fantasy story, the more sensually things and acts are imagined and described, the more plausible the world will be."

### User Testing (Jemisin)
Test worldbuilding with "proof of concept" stories — write scenes in the world to catch "glaring holes."

### Systems Fiction
Portray "how an entire society works rather than a fragment of it" — interconnected foundations create systemic coherence.
