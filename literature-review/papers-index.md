## Key Concepts for Project

### Tolkien's Sub-Creation
- Primary World vs Secondary World
- Secondary Belief (reader immersion)
- Language as worldbuilding foundation
- Mythology enabling language, not reverse

### Wolf's Imaginary Worlds Framework
- Transnarrative, transmedial, transauthorial
- Concentric circles of authorship
- Canonicity and participatory worlds
- Timeline spanning 3,000 years of worldbuilding

### Zaidi's Seven Foundations
1. Political
2. Economic
3. Philosophical
4. Environmental
5. Scientific/Technological
6. Artistic/Aesthetic
7. Social

### Jenkins' Environmental Storytelling
- Evocative spaces (pre-existing associations)
- Enacted stories (staging ground)
- Embedded narratives (mise-en-scene)
- Emergent narratives (player-constructed)

### PCG for Worldbuilding
- Replayability through procedural generation
- LLM integration for narrative PCG
- Search-based PCG for game content
- Dynamic worldbuilding for immersion

### Soviet Prefabricated Housing (ПАНЕЛЬКИ)
- **Khrushchevka** (хрущёвка): Low-cost 3-5 story panelki from 1960s
- **Mikrorayon** (микрорайон): Self-contained residential districts, 10-60ha, ~20,000 people
- **Panel construction**: Concrete prefab panels → fast, cheap, standardized
- 13 million apartments built 1957–1991 in USSR housing campaign
- De-Stalinization: shift from ornate Stalinist style to utilitarian prefab
- 64,000 khrushchevki units in Moscow alone (1961–1968)
- Design features: indoor bathrooms, running water, flush toilets (revolutionary for rural migrants)
- Post-Soviet shift: monolithic construction replacing prefab for design freedom

## Notes

- **Citation sources:** WebSearch = verified via web search; estimate = from model knowledge
- Tolkien foundational for fantasy worldbuilding theory
- Wolf's book is the academic standard ("Bible of imaginary worlds")
- Zaidi's model useful for systematic world design
- Many game narrative papers paywalled (ACM, IEEE) — need university proxy
- Practitioner resources (blogs, templates) valuable for practical application
